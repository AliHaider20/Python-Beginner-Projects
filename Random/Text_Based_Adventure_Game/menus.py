            In a long time ago in a land much diffrent than earth, there existed a great warrior
        who, it was said, could defeat entire armys without really tring. He possesesed a
        sword that could vanqush even the most powerful warrior, no matter their armor. He had
        a set of armor that could not be defeated by even the sharpest sword. There were many
        other items that he had.

            Won day, a monster came and treated the great warrior. He killed the warriors people
        and his friends. The warrior tried to fight the monster, but could not deafeat him. One
        day, he dissapeared. It was rumored that he hid his items hoping that one day, a worthy
        person would find them and destroy the monster.

            Many people had tried to find it but no one had yet. Do you wish to seek the great
        warriors items and slay the beast.
